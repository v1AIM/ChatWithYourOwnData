# DataChat-RAG: Chatbot with Conversational Retrieval Chain
## Project Overview
DataChat-RAG is a chatbot that uses the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique to chat with your own data stored in different formats such as PDF, CSV, TXT, and DOCX. This project allows users to ask questions or extract information from documents using a Conversational Retrieval Chain, enabling efficient and natural language interactions with multi-format data.
